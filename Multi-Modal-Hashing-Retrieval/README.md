# Multi-Modal-Hashing-Retrieval
The baselines of multi-modal hashing retrieval.

## 1. Use

Each method contains 'code/', 'result/' and 'train.sh'.

(1) **"code/"** The source codes folder.

(2) **"result/"** The result folder and the testing results will be recorded in file with the suffix of '.txt'.

(3) **"train.sh"** The training script. The 'dataname' and 'hash bits' will be changed here.

## 3. TODO

(1) The constructDataset.m is too slow in MFKH and DMVH. We will improve the construction process and speed up it.

(2) We will further evaluate the running process of all methods on all datasets.
